                I'm a trans-plant West Virginian...but folks around here suspect nothing.  I'm really a Texan 
                through-and-through.  My long i's and the occasional "ya'll" are my only giveaways.  The reason why my neighbors suspect nothing:  there's really not a whole lot 
                of difference between here and home.  A true feeling of ownership and responsibility to the land, an unfailing
                sense of what it means to be a good neighbor, the tight grasp on one's culture.  These are just some of the qualities of a true West Viriginian
                and what remind me most of the Texans back home.

                But enough about my lovely state...let me tell you why I'm here.  My husband is from West Virginia.  And now
                I'm proud to say that two of my three daughters are West Virginian (one is Coloradian, but that's a story for 
                another day).  His family is still here.  Upon moving here, I quickly fell in love with the beauty of this place.
                I needed to be out in nature as much as possible.  We camp in the summer, road-trip in the fall, and sled in the winter.

                Something not many people know about me:  I'm an introvert.  But before you feel sorry for me, know this: I've never
                been happier.  My career in tech has allowed me to fill my days with the giggles of my toddler, cuddles from my dog,
                a hot tea whenever I want, and the comfort and inspiration that can only come from the view out of the window from my 
                desk at home.
